Hi! 

<img align="right" width="30%" height="30%" src="https://carstenbundt.github.io/assets/images/123.jpg" style= "margin:250px">
My name is Carsten Bundt. I am a cognitive neuroscientist by training with a particular interest in data analysis, visualization, and communication.


I have a bachelors degree in Psychology (supervision by [Rob van der Lubbe](https://people.utwente.nl/r.h.j.vanderlubbe) and [Elger Abrahamse](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/elger-abrahamse)), a masters degree in Cognitive Neuroscience (supervision by [Roshan Cools](https://www.roshancools.com/)), and completed my PhD in Psychology in 2017 under the supervision of [Wim Notebaert](https://www.notelab.be/) and [Marcel Brass](https://social-intelligence-group.github.io/). Currently, I work as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Multimodal Imaging & Cognitive Control lab](https://www.micc-lab.com/) led by [Ren√© Huster](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w0GRwhwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at the University of Oslo. 

You can find my publications [here](https://carstenbundt.github.io/publications/) and my full academic CV [here](https://carstenbundt.github.io/cv/). 

I enjoy being outdoors and going on (long-distance) hikes, and I am a volunteer tour guide for the [Norwegian Trekking Association](https://www.dnt.no/oslo). <!---I post about it on [thehikist.com](https://www.thehikist.com) and [@thehikistcom](https://www.instagram.com/thehikistcom/). -->

This website exists so that I can share what I do and am passionate about and to engage in dialogue with who is interested.
