In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

- [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com)
- [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

- Built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
- Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
- Coded with [Atom](https://atom.io), an amazing open source code editor
