I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Psychology at Oslo University (Norway). My research includes decision-making, reward processing, and executive functions using various neuroscientific methods. As an experienced researcher with a strong background in experimental programming, (statistical) data analysis, and academic writing, I am a proponent of open science and have a particular affinity with data science and machine learning.
